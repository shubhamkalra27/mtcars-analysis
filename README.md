In the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine came out with Data which comprises fuel Consumptions and 10 other aspects of automobile performance. 

**Question**

Does MPG depend on transmission type (automatic vs. manual)?, If so, which is better for MPG? Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.  

**Findings**   

Analysis using the dataset was not able to find significant dependency of transmission type to fuel consumption. For modern cars with higher efficiency, it is less likely that there will be significant difference in Mileage.
